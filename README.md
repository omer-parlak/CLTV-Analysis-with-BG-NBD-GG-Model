The dataset named Online Retail II contains a UK-based online sale store's sales between 01/12/2009 - 09/12/2011. We used data for UK customers from 01/12/2010 - 09/12/2011 years at this project. Because we wanted to use recent data. The product catalog of this company includes souvenirs. The vast majority of the company's customers are corporate customers.
